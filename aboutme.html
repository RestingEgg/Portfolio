                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                    <p>"Ocean" - This is my favourite word. I like it because they are practically the "Life Engine" of our planet and even though the might of this entity is simply startling, we don't seem to sense or experience fear or unrest when we think of oceans. They represent serenity and calmness, which is something that I endear the most. <br>With this, I would like to let you know that I was born on the 5th of December. I am 21 years old as of 2021. Being Tamilian is my ethnicity, but I've spent a fair share of my life in Hyderabad. 
                      My mother helped me cultivate an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and adventure. She induced the importance of treating everything with respect (living or not) in me. My dad taught me the importance of health and fitness, without which nothing is practically possible. He helped me gain knowledge on financial acumen and investment.<br>I wish to offer my family a life that they have never lived. This wish vouches for my sincerity and dedication on any task or job that I undertake, or any situation that I am presented with.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Education:</h3><br>
                    <ul>
                      <h5>VIT Vellore - Vellore (CSE) </h5> <p>- Made a lot of friends and memories, even though 2 years of my college life was spent online.</p>
                      <h5>FIITJEE - Hyderabad (MPC) - 95%</h5><p> - Hit my growth spurt, studied hard in the wrong direction, made a lot of friends and memories and had a crush on a girl which I never confessed.</p>
                      <h5>Johnson Grammar School - Hyderabad(ICSE) - 90%</h5><p> - I was a kid and everyone was atleast 0.35* taller than me, made a lot of friends and memories.
                     
                      </ul><br>                    
                    <h3>Why Engineering?</h3>
                    <p>I did not enjoy rote learning, and Engineering was an option for me to avoid that. The usual case is parents want their child to either become an engineer or a doctor in India, but I was asked to become a charted accountant, but when I explained them why engineering was good for me, they agreed.<br>I chose CSE in particular because I am good at Mathematics and patterns, so the field was an obvious choice for me and CSE offers innumerable roads to the future of technological innovation, which fills me with inquisitiveness and enthusiasm.</p><br>
                    <h3>What next?</h3>
                    <p>Putting things into perspective, I feel that whatever VIT has offered me was only 10% of the learning and development, and the majority lies in applying the knowledge gained, in an organisation which is dedicated to software engineering.<br> So I wish to work for a few years, helping me realise my strengths and interests, based upon which I will either pursue MS or an MBA. I don't have much plans to leave my country and settle abroad. Don't get me wrong with being less motivated. </p><br><br>
